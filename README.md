## 1. Installing CoqGym

We recommend [using CoqGym in Docker]((#2-using-coqgym-in-docker), as CoqGym has many dependencies and is nontrivial to set up correctly. If Docker is not an option, here are the steps to obtain the CoqGym dataset and build the interaction environment natively.


### 1.1 Dependencies

* [OPAM](https://opam.ocaml.org/)
* [Anaconda Python 3](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/)
* [LMDB](https://symas.com/lmdb/)
* [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/)


### 1.2 Building Coq, SerAPI, CoqHammer, and the Coq Projects

1. Create an OPAM switch for OCaml 4.07.1+flambda: `opam switch create 4.07.1+flambda && eval $(opam env)`
1. Upgrade the installed OPAM packages (optional): `opam upgrade && eval $(opam env)`
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/princeton-vl/CoqGym`
1. Install Coq, SerAPI and CoqHammer: `cd CoqGym && source install.sh`
1. Build the Coq projects (can take a while): `cd coq_projects && make && cd ..`
1. Create and activate the conda environment: `conda env create -f coq_gym.yml && conda activate coq_gym`

*Note*: [Coq](https://github.com/coq/coq), [SerAPI](https://github.com/ejgallego/coq-serapi), [CoqHammer](https://github.com/lukaszcz/coqhammer), and the Coq projects in [coq_projects](./coq_projects) directory are indendent software projects with their own code repositories, but please follow the instructions above to build the specific versions we need.

### 1.3 Extracting the Proofs from Coq Code (Optional)

We include the code for extracting CoqGym from Coq source code. However, it is not guaranteed to reproduce exactly the same data. The timeout and other miscellaneous errors during the data extraction may be machine-dependent. For example, a faster machine is likely to have fewer timeout errors and thus can extract more proofs.
For benchmark purpose, please download and use our pre-extracted version of CoqGym.

1. Check all Coq files and locate the proofs:   
    For each `*.meta` file in `./coq_projects/`, run `python check_proofs.py --file /path/to/*.meta`   
    Now you have generated a `*.json` file in `./data/` corresponding to each `*.meta` file. The `proofs` field of the JSON object is a list containing the proof names.
    
2. Extract the proofs:  
    For each `*.meta` file and each proof, run:  
    `python extract_proof.py --file /path/to/*.meta --proof $PROOF_NAME`  
    `python extract_synthetic_proofs.py --file /path/to/*.meta --proof $PROOF_NAME`

3. Post-processing: `python postprocess.py`

*Caveat*: The steps above are computationally expensive. When we say "For each XXX, run `YYY`", the tasks are embarrassingly parallel, which means you can run them in parallel in any order. We do not provide the code for that because it depends on a particular HPC infrastructure.



### 1.4 Downloading the Pre-extracted Proofs (Recommended)

1. Download the CoqGym dataset [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/149m_17VkYYkl0kdSB4AI8zodCuTmPaA6?usp=sharing)

2. Unzip the data and set the paths: `python unzip_data.py`

*Caveat*: The second step sets the absolute paths in the data. You have to re-do it whenever the absolote path of the `data/` directory changes (e.g. after moving the entire repo to another directory).

Now you are ready to interact with CoqGym! Run `python eval_env.py` to check if it terminates normally without raising an error.


---


## 2. Using CoqGym in Docker

As a less painful alternative to [installing CoqGym](#1-installing-coqgym) from scratch, we provide a [Docker image with everything pre-installed](https://hub.docker.com/r/yangky11/coq-gym). The image was built from this [Dockerfile](./Dockerfile). It includes the CoqGym dataset, proof steps extracted from the dataset, our pre-trained ASTactic model, and all necessary dependencies such as OPAM, Z3, CVC4, Vampire, and E Prover. You shouldn't need to download anything else if you choose to use the Docker image.



---


## 3. Data Format

The dataset contains three parts:

* The `data` directory: `*.json` files corresponding to the `*.v` files in Coq source code, whose format is explained below. The `*.json` files contain all important information about the proofs: environment, local context, goals, tactics, proof trees, etc.

* The `sexp_cache` directory: A LMDB file that serves as an index for the S-expressions in `*.json` files. The `*.json` files contain keys for querying `sexp_cache`

* `projs_split.json`: A JSON object containing the training/validation/testing split

### 3.1 JSON Files

Each `*.json` file in `data/` corresponds to a Coq source file `*.v` in `coq_projects/`. For example, `data/StructTact/Assoc.json` corresponds to [coq_projects/StructTact/Assoc.v](https://github.com/princeton-vl/CoqGym/blob/master/coq_projects/StructTact/Assoc.v). 

The format of the JSON files is described below. 
The hash codes are used as keys to query the LMDB `sexp_cache`.
Consult the [glossary](#33-glossary) for the terminology.
```
{
    'filename': 'Assoc.v',            # the path of the Coq source file relative to the root directory of the Coq project
    'coq_project': 'StructTact',      # the name of the Coq project
    'vernac_cmds': [                  # a list of Coq commands [6] in the source file
        ['Cd "$COQGYM_ROOT/coq_projects/StructTact".', 'VernacChdir',  '3701e61f37b72b3e61788fce6317466b7bb92b55'],     # [raw command, command type, command AST (in hash code)]
        ['Arguments a_equiv {_} {_} _ _ _.', 'VernacArguments', '6777d3c472595dae20427d0892ad03d38f70fde9'],
        ...
        ['Arguments a_equiv {_} {_} _ _ _.', 'VernacArguments', '6777d3c472595dae20427d0892ad03d38f70fde9'],
    ],
   'num_extra_cmds': 107,             # the code in the original Coq file starts at vernac_cmds[num_extra_cmds]
   'proofs': [                        # a list of human-written proofs
       ...
    ],
    'synthetic_proofs': [             # a list of synthetic proofs
       ...
    ],
}
```


The format for a proof is as follows, taking the [`get_set_same`](https://github.com/princeton-vl/CoqGym/tree/master/coq_projects/StructTact/Assoc.v#L47) in `coq_projects/StructTact/Assoc.v` as an example.

    'line_nb': 118,                   # the theorem is defined in $file_data['vernac_cmds'][$line_nb]

### 3.2 LMDB File

`sexp_cache` is a LMDB mapping hash codes in `*.json` files to their corresponding S-expressions. Below is a code snippet in Python for accessing them.
```Python
from utils import SexpCache
sexp_cache = SexpCache('sexp_cache')
print(sexp_cache['333b2895c8e62d21856476bf89fa9681c9058bb9'])
```

## 4. Data Utilities

We include some tools for interacting with CoqGym, but they are NOT a part of the dataset. 
You may implement your own tools for similar purposes.


### 4.1 Interacting with CoqGym

`eval_env.py` enables the interaction with the proofs in CoqGym. 
See [ASTactic/agent.py](ASTactic/agent.py) for examples.


### 4.2 Parsing Coq Terms

* `gallina.py`: a parser the S-expressions of Coq terms. 
It may be useful for learning the embeddings of the term ASTs. 

* `utils.py`: functions for iterating through all proofs or Coq files in the dataset.


### 4.3 Computing Dataset Statistics 

* `stats/count_human_proofs.py`: count the number of human-written proofs in CoqGym.

* `stats/count_synthetic_proofs.py`: count the number of synthetic-written proofs in CoqGym.

* `stats/proofs.py`: compute some statistics of the proofs.


---


## 5. The ASTactic Model

![ASTactic](/images/astactic.jpg)

Here we describe how to train and test the ASTactic model on CoqGym. 
The following content is NOT a part of the CoqGym dataset, and therefore you do not need it if you only want to access the data.

### 5.1 Prerequisites

* Make sure CoqGym has been properly installed and configured. The `coq_gym` conda environment is activated, the OPAM switch is on `4.07.1+flambda`.
* Automated theorem provers: [Vampire](https://vprover.github.io), [CVC4](http://cvc4.cs.stanford.edu/), [Eprover](http://www.eprover.org), and [Z3](https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3). Install all of them and make sure they are accessible in PATH, otherwise you may see a performance degradation of the hammer baseline.
* [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/): Install the correct version for your hardware in the conda environment `coq_gym`.
* The instructions below assume that you are in the [ASTactic](./ASTactic/) directory.



### 5.2 Extracting Proof Steps

The ASTactic model is trained on individual proof steps, rather than entire proofs.
After obtaining the CoqGym dataset, run `python extract_proof_steps.py`. This can take a while, and you have the option to run it in parallel, please see the `--filter` option in the source code for details.


The extracted proof steps are in `proof_steps/`. You can double-check the number of proof steps to make sure everything works as expected: 

Directory |  # files
------------ | -------------
proof_steps/train | 121,644
proof_steps/valid | 68,180


### 5.3 Training

To train on the proof steps in training + validation set: `python main.py --no_validation --exp_id astactic`  
The "astactic" above is an experiment ID, and you may change it to other IDs. Model checkpoints will be saved to `runs/astactic/checkpoints/`. See `options.py` for command line options.

A pre-trained model can be downloaded [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1AzLaEpoGS3BPMUz9Bl63MHAFRqlF4CtH?usp=sharing).


### 5.4 Testing 

Assuming you want to test the model checkpoint `runs/astactic/checkpoints/model_003.pth` on the proof `get_set_same` in `../data/StructTact/Assoc.json`:

* Testing ASTactic:   
    `python evaluate.py ours ours-TEST --path runs/astactic/checkpoints/model_003.pth --file ../data/StructTact/Assoc.json --proof "get_set_same"`

* Testing an automated tactic X (may be "auto", "trivial", "easy", "intuition", or "hammer"):   
    `python -u evaluate.py X X-TEST --file ../data/StructTact/Assoc.json --proof "get_set_same"` 

* Testing ASTactic+X:   
    `python -u evaluate.py ours+X ours+X-TEST --path runs/astactic/checkpoints/model_003.pth --file ../data/StructTact/Assoc.json --proof "get_set_same"`


*Caveat*: Testing is computationally expensive, but the workloads are embarrassingly parallel, which means you can run them in parallel in any order. We do not provide the code for that because it depends on a particular HPC infrastructure.
