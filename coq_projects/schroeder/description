Institution: INRIA Rocquencourt
Description: 
   Fraenkel's proof of Schroeder-Bernstein theorem on decidable sets 
   is formalized in a constructive variant of set theory based on 
   stratified universes (the one defined in the Ensemble library).
   The informal proof can be found for instance in "Axiomatic Set Theory"
   from P. Suppes.
