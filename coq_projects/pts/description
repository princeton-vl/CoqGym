Title: A formalisation of Pure Type Systems
Author: Bruno Barras
Institution: LIX - INRIA Futurs
Description:
  This contrib is a formalization of Pure Type Systems. It includes most
  of the basic metatheoretical properties: weakening, substitution,
  subject-reduction, decidability of type-checking (for strongly normalizing
  PTSs). Strengtheningis not proven here.

  The kernel of a very simple proof checker is automatically generated from
  the proofs. A small interface allows interacting with this kernel, making
  up a standalone proof system. 

  The Makefile has a special target "html" that produces html files from the
  sources and main.html that gives a short overview.
