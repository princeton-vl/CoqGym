Description: The basis of the contribution is a formalization of the
theory of oriented angles of non-zero vectors. Then, we prove some
classical plane geometry theorems: the theorem which gives a necessary
and sufficient condition so that four points are cocyclic, the one
which shows that the reflected points with respect to the sides of a
triangle orthocenter are on its circumscribed circle, the Simson's
theorem and the Napoleon's theorem. The reader can refer to the
associated research report (http://www-sop.inria.fr/lemme/FGRR.ps) and
