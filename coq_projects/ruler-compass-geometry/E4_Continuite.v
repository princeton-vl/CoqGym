(* D2 (Dedekind) : Suppose the points of a line l are divided into two nonemty substes S, T in such a way that no point of S is between two points of T, and no point of T is between two points of S. Then there exists a unique point P such that for any A ¸ B and any B ¸ T, either A = P or B = P or the point P is between A and B. *)

(* D2 (Cantor) : For any infinite seqence of segments {AnBn}, n ¸ N of a straight line a with the property that AiBi is included into the inside segment Ai-1Bi-1 for all i = 2, 3, 4, c, and there is not a segment situated inside all the segments in the sequence under consideration, there is a point M on a belonging to the inside of each segment in the sequence. *)

(* These lemmas cannot be verified in a geometry with only ruler and compass as constructors. *)
